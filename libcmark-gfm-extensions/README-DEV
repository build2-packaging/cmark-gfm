This document describes how libcmark-gfm-extensions was packaged for build2.
In particular, this understanding will be useful when upgrading to a new
upstream version. See ../README-DEV for general notes on cmark-gfm packaging.

Symlink the required upstream files and directories into
libcmark-gfm-extensions/:

$ mkdir -p libcmark-gfm-extensions/extensions
$ pushd libcmark-gfm-extensions/extensions
$ ln -s ../../../upstream/extensions/*.{c,h} ./

Also patch the broken cmark-gfm-core-extensions.h header (see the reported
issue #244 for details):

$ mv cmark-gfm-core-extensions.h cmark-gfm-core-extensions.h.orig
$ cp cmark-gfm-core-extensions.h.orig cmark-gfm-core-extensions.h
$ git apply fix-core-extensions-header.patch
$ popd

Note that patches are produced by commands similar to the following:

$ git diff >fix-core-extensions-header.patch

Create cmark-gfm-extensions_export.h defining CMARK_GFM_EXTENSIONS_EXPORT
macro.
